# Facemask_Detection_using_Faster_RCNN
Technologies used: Python, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV.

## Problem Description
This GitHub repository focuses on implementing Faster-RCNN on a Facemask dataset using TensorFlowâ€™s Object Detection API.
The dataset that we will use is available on Kaggle as Face Mask Detection (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection). With this dataset, it is possible to construct an object detection model to identify people wearing masks, not wearing them, or inappropriately wearing them. This dataset contains 853 images belonging to the 3 classes and their bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format. The classes are:
  1. With mask
  2. Without mask
  3. Mask wore incorrectly.
To do object detection to identify if people in the image are wearing a facemask, we will follow specific steps to obtain a fully trained model for object detection
  1. Set our TensorFlow1 Directory.
  2. Create an Anaconda Virtual Environment.
  3. Customize particular files according to our dataset.
  4. Train the Model on Google Colab.
  5. Test the model on Anaconda Command Prompt.
 
Test the model on Anaconda Command Prompt.
So before starting these steps, please make sure that you have installed the Anaconda Navigator (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) because we will be primarily using the Anaconda virtual environment to build out the Facemask Detection model.
